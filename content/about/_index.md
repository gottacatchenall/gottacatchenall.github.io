Hi!

I'm Michael D. Catchen (he/him). 

I'm an [IVADO](http://www.ivado.ca) Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Poisot
Computational Ecology Lab](http://poisotlab.io) at the [Université de
Montréal](http://umontreal.ca). I received my PhD from McGill University under
the supervision of [Dr. Andy Gonzalez](http://thegonzalezlab.org), working on
computational methods to understand biogeography and the dynamics of species
interaction networks. 

Currently, my research focuses on species distribution modeling using machine
learning, making "black-box" ML models interpretable for environmental
management and conservation decision making, and designing biodiversity
monitoring programs to best understand how human activity is changing life on
Earth. I'm also usually doing some
[networky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) (and at least
tangentially [ecological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web)) stuff on the
side. You can read more [here](/research).

Besides science, I like nature, cooking, punk music, breakfast burritos, life, math
for it's own sake, and a bunch of other things. If you want to talk about
science, or something else, [hit me up](mailto:michael.catchen@umontreal.ca).
